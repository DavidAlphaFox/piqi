OVERVIEW
========

Piqi is a set of languages and open-source tools for working with structured
data. It includes:

        * High-level data representation (Piq) and data definition languages
        (Piqi).

        * Support for binary and JSON encodings for portable data
        representation.

        * Tools for validating, pretty-printing and converting data between
        different formats: Piq, JSON, binary.

        * Mappings to various programing languages allowing programs to
        serialize and deserialize data in a portable manner.


The combination of data representation (Piq) and data definition (Piqi)
languages is similar to the concept of "valid XML" (i.e. XML with XML Schema).
However, unlike XML, Piq has a concise, clean syntax and a data model similar
to those of high-level programming languages such as ML.

In addition to that, Piqi supports binary encoding and static language mappings
which makes it similar to cross-language data serialization tools like Google
Protocol Buffers or ASN.1.

In fact, Piqi was inspired by Google Protocol Buffers
(http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) and designed to be largely compatible
with it. Like Protocol Buffers, Piqi relies on type definitions and supports
data schema evolution. The main difference is that Piqi has a richer data model,
high-level modules and a human-friendly data representation language (Piq).
