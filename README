OVERVIEW
========

Piqi is a set of languages and tools for working with structured data. It
includes:

        * High-level data representation and data definition languages.

        * Universal binary encoding.

        * Tools for validating, pretty-printing and converting data into
        different formats.

        * Mappings to various programing languages allowing programs to
        serialize and deserialize data in a portable manner.

        * Open-source implementation.


The combination of data presentation (Piq) and data definition (Piqi) languages
is similar to the concept of "valid XML" (i.e. XML with XML Schema). However,
unlike XML, Piq has a concise, clean syntax and a data model similar to data
models of high-level programming languages such as ML.

Piqi also supports binary encoding and language mappings which makes it similar
to cross-language data serialization tools like Google Protocol Buffers or
ASN.1.
