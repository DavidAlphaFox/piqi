This directory contains an example of addressbook data structure and several
OCaml and Erlang programs: for adding a person to the addressbook and listing the
contents of the addressbook.

This example is based on Google Protocol Buffers examples:

        http://protobuf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/
        (See their README.txt file for details)


The data definition file "addressbook.proto.piqi" is converted from the original
"addressbook.proto".

OCaml and Erlang programs implement exactly the same functionality as Python,
Java and C++ programs from Protobuf examples. The data structure and the binary
encoding for the addressbook data structure is fully compatible as well, so
OCaml and Erlang programs can read addressbook created by Python/C++/Java
program and vice versa.

This example contains "addressbook.piq" which is a sample addressbook
represented as piq file. It can also be converted to the binary format using
the following command:

        piqi convert -t pb addressbook.piq


See "./test" for more usage examples. Use "./test ocaml" and "./test erlang"
commands to run the tests.

Note that Erlang build is disabled by default. Run "make erlang" to build Erlang
programs.
