OVERVIEW
========

Piqi is a set of languages and open-source tools for working with structured
data. It includes:

        * Cross-language data serialization system compatible with Google
        Protocol Buffers. It allows programs implemented in various languages to
        exchange and persist data in a portable manner.

        * High-level data representation (Piq) and data definition languages
        (Piqi).

        * Tools for validating, pretty-printing and converting data between
        Piq, JSON and portable binary encoding.


As a data serialization system, Piqi follows a static approach, when high-level
data specification is used to generate static code for serializing and
deserializing data structures.

Piqi implements native support for OCaml and Erlang programming languages.
Connectivity with other languages is provided via Google Protocol Buffers.

In fact, Piqi was inspired by Google Protocol Buffers and specially designed to
be largely compatible with it. Like Protocol Buffers, Piqi relies on type
definitions and supports data schema evolution. The main difference is that Piqi
has a richer data model, high-level modules and a human-friendly data
representation language (Piq).

The combination of data representation (Piq) and data definition (Piqi)
languages is similar to the concept of "valid XML" (i.e. XML conforming to some
XML Schema). However, unlike XML, Piq has a concise, clean syntax and a data
model similar to those of high-level programming languages such as ML.
