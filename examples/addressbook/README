This is an example of addressbook data structure, data representation and OCaml
programs for adding a person to the addressbok and listing the contents of the
addressbook.

It is based on Google Protocol Buffers
examples:
        http://protobuf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/
        (See README.txt file for details)


The data definition file "addressbook.proto.piqi" is converted from the original
"addressbook.proto".

OCaml programs implement exactly the same functionality as Python, Java and C++
programs from Protobuf examples.  The data structure and the binary encoding for
addressbook is fully compatible as well, so OCaml program can read addressbook
created by Python/C++/Java program and the other way around.

This example contains "addressbook.piq" which is a sample addressbook structured
represented as piq file. It can also be converted to the binary format using
this command:
        piqi convert -t pb addressbook.piq


See "./test_ocaml" for more usage examples.
