Piqi tests 
==========

To build, run and re-run the tests, use "make"


NOTE: "boot_proto2piqi" is not originally a test. See boot_proto2piqi/README for
details.


Prerequisites
=============

For "boot_proto2piqi" and "cpp" tests Protocol Buffers headers and .so libraries
must be available in standard OS paths. If they are installed to a custom path,
use "export CXXFLAGS= -I <headers path> -L <library path>" to specify their
locations.

"piqi_proto" test requires access to Protobuf source directory. See
piqi_proto/README for details.
