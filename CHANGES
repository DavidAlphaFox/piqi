Piqi 0.5.3 (October 19, 2010)
=============================

Added initial support for Piqi-light -- lightweight EBNF-like syntax for Piqi
data definition language.

Piqi tools:

  - New "piqi light" command for printing .piqi in Piqi-light syntax.
  - Improved pretty-printing of .piqi by transforming output Piq AST. Mainly
    affects "piqi expand".
  - Added support for "-o" option to "piqi to-proto", "piqi of-proto" commands.
  - Improved floats reversibility in Piq (unified this part with JSON
    generator). Affects "proto convert -t piq".

piqic:

  - (ocaml) Simplified generated OCaml type definitions.

Bug fixes:

  - Timely reset location DB to allow garbage collection of objects. Affects
    "piqi convert" and "piqi pp".
  - Fixed several problems with "piqi expand".
  - Fixed printing order for "unknown field" warnings.


Piqi 0.5.2 (September 13, 2010)
===============================

Added Erlang support:

  - "piqic erlang" -- a new piqic backend for for generating Erlang type
    specifications and encoding/decoding functions.
  - "piqirun-erlang" -- runtime support library.

piqic:

  - (ocaml, erlang) Normalize Piqi identifiers by default, i.e. convert
    "CamlCase" identifiers to "caml-case".
  - (ocaml, erlang) Don't generate codecs and types for unused defintions from
    the boot module.

piqirun-ocaml:

  Backward incompatible changes:

  - Combined piqirun-ocaml library into one "piqirun" OCaml module (previously
    there were two: "piqirun_gen" and "piqirun_parse").
  - Improved piqirun-ocaml buffer initialization interface (unified it with
    piqirun-erlang).

  Other changes:

  - Ignore duplicate fields instead of producing an error.

Piqi tools:

  - Generate warnings instead of errors on duplicate fields when reading from
    Piq format.
  - Ignore duplicate fields when reading from wire format.

Platform support:

  - Now builds and runs on Mac OS X (fixed some build portability problems).


Piqi 0.5.1 (August 17, 2010)
============================

Major changes include support for JSON encoding and providing compatibility
with OCaml 3.12.0.

Piqi tools:

  - "piqi convert" command now supports two new encodings: "json" (plain JSON)
    and "piq-json" (JSON with Piq type annotation for top-level objects).
  - A new command: "piqi json-pp" for pretty-printing JSON files.

Piqi language:

  - Added support for "json-name" property for type definitions, fields and
    options. When specified, it will be used as a name for correspondent JSON
    field names instead of "name".
  - Renamed "ignore-field" top-level directive to "custom-field".

Other changes:

  - Provided compatibility with the latest OCaml release (3.12.0). Improved
    support for older OCaml versions >= 3.10.


Piqi 0.5.0 (July 9, 2010)
